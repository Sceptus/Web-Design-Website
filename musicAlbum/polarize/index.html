    <p>
      Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down <br />
      Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems <br />
      Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out <br />
      My friends and I, we got a lot of problems <br />
      You know where I'm coming from <br />
      Though I am running to you <br />
      All I feel is deny, deny, denial <br />
      I wanted to be a better brother, better son <br />
      Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done <br />
      I have none to show to the one I love <br />
      But deny, deny, denial <br />

      Polarize is taking your disguises <br />
      Separating 'em, splitting 'em up from wrong and right <br />
      It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight <br />
      Deny, deny, denial <br />
      I wanted to be a better brother, better son <br />
      Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done <br />
      I have none to show to the one I love <br />
      But deny, deny, denial <br />
