    <h2>Tear in My Heart</h2>

    <p>
      Oh, oh <br />
      Oh, oh <br />
      Sometimes you gotta bleed to know <br />
      That you're alive and have a soul <br />
      But it takes someone to come around <br />
      To show you how <br />
      She's the tear in my heart <br />
      I'm alive <br />
      She's the tear in my heart <br />
      I'm on fire <br />
      She's the tear in my heart <br />
      Take me higher <br />
      Than I've ever been <br />
      Songs on the radio are okay <br />
      My taste in music is your face <br />
      But it takes a song to come around <br />
      To show you how <br />
      She's the tear in my heart <br />
      I'm alive <br />
      She's the tear in my heart <br />
      I'm on fire <br />
      She's the tear in my heart <br />
      Take me higher <br />
      Than I've ever been <br />
      Than I've ever been <br />
      Than I've ever been <br />
      Than I've ever been <br />
      Oh, than I've ever been <br />
      You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time <br />
      But that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine <br />
      I'm driving, here I sit, cursing my government <br />
      For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement <br />
      You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time <br />

      Take me higher <br />
      Than I've ever been <br />
      My heart is my armor <br />
      She's the tear in my heart <br />
      She's a carver <br />
      She's a butcher with a smile <br />
      Cut me farther <br />
      Than I've ever been <br />
      Than I've ever been <br />
      Than I've ever been <br />
      Oh, than I've ever been <br />
