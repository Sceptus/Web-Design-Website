    <h2>Stressed Out</h2>

    <p>
      I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard <br />
      I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words <br />
      I wish I found some chords in an order that is new <br />
      I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang <br />
      I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink <br />
      But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think <br />
      My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br />
      My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br />
      Wish we could turn back time <br />
      To the good old days <br />
      When our mama sang us to sleep <br />
      But now we're stressed out (oh) <br />
      Wish we could turn back time (oh) <br />
      To the good old days (oh) <br />
      When our mama sang us to sleep <br />
      But now we're stressed out <br />
      We're stressed out <br />
      Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young <br />
      How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from? <br />
      I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it <br />
      Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one <br />
      It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose <br />
      Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam <br />
      But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered <br />
      Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter <br />
      My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br />
      My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br />
      Wish we could turn back time <br />

      Wish we could turn back time (oh) <br />
      To the good old days (oh) <br />
      When our mama sang us to sleep <br />
      But now we're stressed out <br />
      Used to play pretend, give each other different names <br />
      We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away <br />
      Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying <br />
      "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah <br />

      We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money <br />
      We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money <br />
      Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money <br />
      We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money <br />
